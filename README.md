## Problem Statement
As COVID-19 is prolonged, the "COVID-19 Blue" phenomenon, which feels depressed, is spreading. In particular, young people in their 20s and 30s are reaching a level that threatens normal life. According to a recent COVID-19 national mental health survey released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in the first quarter of 2021, the proportion of depression risk groups in their 20s and 30s is more than twice as high as those in their 20s and 30s and 60s (14.4%), respectively, indicating that young people are more negatively affected by COVID-19.  

In particular, more than half of college students think their lives are not happy, and their happiness index is 53.3 points on average based on 100 points. According to Albamon's survey of 989 male and female college students on the "Happiness Index & Stress Index" college students themselves scored 53.3 points on average out of 100.

## Mission Statement
However, college students are reluctant to consult a psychiatric counseling that the medical records will affect the purpose later.  
Therefore, we want to prepare a method of making psychological counseling bonds.
